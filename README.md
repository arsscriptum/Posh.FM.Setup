# Script to manage Installation and Update of FM Software

Based of Reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/11z0suu/anyone_here_do_powershell_for_hire/) from user [wb6vpm](https://www.reddit.com/user/wb6vpm/).

```
	Looking to get a script made to install a software application, as well as "maintain" it (such as software updates, or license key updates). I am looking for it to check to see if the software is installed, if so, whether it was installed by the script or not (via a "tracking file" most likely that would contain a few lines of information in it, such as installed version & current license key).

	A quick flow diagram of what I'm thinking: https://www.dropbox.com/s/op0fuonzatwm2re/FM_Install_Script_Flow.png?raw=1

	Mods: if this isn't allowed here, my apologies, please just let me know, and delete this post

	Edit to include some additional information: This will be getting deployed on an AD network, unfortunately, the software does not like to cooperate with standard GPO software installation (when it's time for updating the software, it breaks everything).
